# Fonts

This is the collection of fonts I install on my machines, using
[install-fonts](https://github.com/smkent/dotfiles/blob/master/.dotfiles/bin/install-fonts)
in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/smkent/dotfiles) repository.

I also install the the [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts),
which are not included here.

## Font Directories

* [google](/google): [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which are
[open source](https://fonts.google.com/about).
